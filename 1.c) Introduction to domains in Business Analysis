Business analysis is a dynamic field that covers various domains, each critical to the successful identification, analysis, 
and resolution of business needs. Domains refer to the specific industries or areas where business analysts apply their skills.
Each domain has unique characteristics, processes, and challenges. There are two primary types of business domain and solution domain.

Business or industry knowledge domains are industry specific areas where business analysts operate. 
Examples
finance, 
healthcare, 
telecommunications,
retail, 
manufacturing, 
energy and utilities, 
education,
public sector, 
technology, 
automotive. 

Solution domains are based on technical knowledge. 
Examples 
enterprise resource planning or ERP, 
customer relationship management or CRM, 
supply chain management or SCM, e-commerce,
data analytics, 
business intelligence. 

Each industry includes different functions such as
marketing,
human resources, 
sales, 
IT.

These functions within business domains often drive the need for a particular solution domain.
Creating a symbiotic relationship between the industry specific needs and the technical solutions used to address them.

The two types of domains, business domain and solution domain, often overlap.
For example, a business analyst working in the healthcare domain might focus on an electronic health records or EHR solution. 
Business analysis involves a range of activities that are crucial for addressing specific needs. 
These activities are as stakeholder engagement, strategy analysis, requirement analysis and design definition, 
business process management or BPM, data analysis. IT systems analysis, solution evaluation, and solution deployment.
Understanding how these activities align with different domains can provide insight into how they contribute to overall business success.
The stakeholder engagement activity focuses on effective stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle.

In the business domain, this involves identifying and understanding key stakeholders in the industry. 
In the solution domain, the focus of this activity is to engage stakeholders in technical projects and changes. 
For a manufacturing domain, a business analyst might engage with supply chain managers and IT teams to implement a
new inventory management system. Strategy analysis focuses on understanding and aligning strategic goals with the
business and technological environment. For the business domain, strategy analysis involves understanding the industrys 
strategic goals and market conditions. Whereas in the solution domain, the focus is on aligning IT strategies with 
business objectives. For example, in the finance domain, a business analyst might conduct strategy analysis to align 
digital banking solutions with regulatory compliance and market trends.

The requirements analysis and design definition activity bridges the gap between business requirements and solutions. 
For the business domain, the focus is on understanding business needs and stakeholder requirements. Regarding the solution domain, 
this activity involves documenting the requirements clearly and designing technical solutions. For example, in the telecommunications 
domain, a business analyst might gather requirements for a new customer service platform. Ensuring it meets the needs of both 
customers and regulatory standards. The business process management, or BPM activity focuses on optimizing and improving 
organizational processes. For the business domain, BPM involves knowing industry specific processes and practices.

For the solution domain, this activity involves using tools like business process modeling and notation, or BPMN, to model 
and improve processes. A business analyst working in the healthcare domain might use BPM to streamline patient intake processes, 
ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations while improving patient outcomes. The data analysis activity involves analyzing
and interpreting data for informed decision making. In the business domain, data analysis involves interpreting data in the 
context of industry trends and business objectives. For the solution domain, this involves using analytical tools and technologies 
to analyze data. For example, a business analyst in the education domain might analyze student performance data to identify trends
and inform curriculum development. The IT systems analysis activity focuses on the role of IT systems within an organization.

In the business domain, the focus is on understanding how IT systems support business functions. In the solution domain, 
this activity involves designing and implementing IT systems. For example, in the public sector domain, a business analyst
might work on designing a government records management system that ensures data security and accessibility. 
The solution evaluation activity focuses on determining whether a proposed solution delivers the expected value. 
In the business domain, this activity involves evaluating if the solution meets business goals. In the solution domain, 
this involves assessing the solution's technical performance and return on investment, ROI. For a retail domain, 
where a business analyst might evaluate the performance of an e commerce platform to ensure it enhances the customer shopping experience 
and meets sales targets.

The solution deployment activity involves the rollout of a solution. In the business domain, the focus is on ensuring the 
solution fits the business environment. In the solution domain, this involves managing technical deployment and integration. 
For the energy and utilities domain, a business analyst might oversee the deployment of a new energy management system. 
Ensuring it integrates with existing infrastructure and meets regulatory standards. Domain knowledge is essential for 
successful business analysis. It enhances communication with stakeholders using industry-specific terms, improves 
problem solving by identifying root causes.

And supports better decision making with insights into trends and challenges. It also enables tailored solutions
that meet specific business needs and ensures compliance with industry regulations, reducing the risk of penalties. 
Let's recap. The two main domain types are business domains, which are industry specific, and solution domains, 
which focus on solution types. The key activities in business analysis are as follows stakeholder engagement, 
strategy analysis, requirement analysis and design definition. Business process management, data analysis, 
IT systems analysis, solution evaluation, and solution deployment. Each activity aligns with the domains and 
contributes to overall business success.
